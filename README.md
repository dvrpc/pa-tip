# PA TIP 2018
The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) is pleased to present the DVRPC Fiscal Year 2019 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for Pennsylvania (FY19-FY22). DVRPC and its PA member governments have worked diligently to prepare a program of projects that responds to the needs of the region and at the same time complies with federal and state policies. The TIP is the regionally agreed-upon list of priority transportation projects, and federal law requires showing at least four federal fiscal years of programming. This document, referred to as the FY2019 TIP for PA includes cost, phase, and schedule information for transportation projects in each of the federal fiscal years FY19-FY22 for Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia Counties.

## What is the PA TIP website?
The PA TIP website includes an interactive method for displaying maps and project listings, as well as a way to submit comments during the public comment period. Using Mapboxgl JS as a base, projects can be located via a robust search that allows users to directly access a project by MPMS ID, or to search by area and filter down by project type.
